## Summary
This code is using for() loops and Random() to draw hundreds of points connect with lines.

## Plan
I used Random() to create a lot of points, since lines also need the point position, I matched them in pairs. After defining the point in Random(), I used the same xy-coordinate to define the line.

## Hard & Fun
It is hard to think how to connect all the points, but it is easier to connect two points together to create a line. I think the change of thinking is interesting during the working process.
